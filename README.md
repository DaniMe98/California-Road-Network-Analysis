# California-Road-Network-Analysis
A What-if Analysis conducted on the California Road Network for the Social Network Analysis project work

In this project I am considering the data coming from “California road network”, which consists of a directed graph, with labelled nodes and edges that connect them, saved in a .txt file in a structure like: ”FromNodeId    ToNodeId”. 

The dataset is available at http://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-CA.html
